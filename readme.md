A simple js countdown that I built for an android hackathon that I was organizing in my college.
It hasn't been customized much. Change the countdown time in main.js. Feel free to fork and add features or use for your own purpose.

Uses: Progressbar.js Release 0.7.4
Skeleton CSS Boilerplate,
and plain old javascript.
